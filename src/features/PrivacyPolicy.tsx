      At HALP, we value your privacy and have a strong focus on keeping your data secure. This privacy policy contains information about how we collect, and use your information. By using the Help Assistant Lab Program (HALP) you consent to the collection, use and sharing of the information as stated in this privacy policy.

      The usage of HALP is not restricted to logging in as a user. The system provides the ability to use it without logging in using your email address and nickname. This leaves two scenarios:

    <Text style={[{color: text, fontSize: 16, marginTop: 0 }]}>
      We may collect information such as your email address, nickname and discord tag. There is no need to actually enter your real name, which is why this field is called "nickname". Ticket information: We may collect information created by you in the app, such as tickets, courses and user roles. This content is all stored in the HALP system until you decide to remove it yourself.
